# üì£ Welcome to the Rootski codebase!

This is the codebase for the application running at [rootski.io](https://www.rootski.io).

> üóí Note: you can find detailed information about the [architecture/tech stack](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Architecture-9892c9f2159e4865a4438c163e235c41), onboarding/contributing, general full-stack development training resources and more on our [knowledge base](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Knowledge-Base-49bb8843b6424ada9f49c22151014cfc).

Rootski is a full-stack application for studying the Russian language by learning roots.

Rootski uses an A.I. algorithm called a "transformer" to break Russian words into roots. Rootski enriches
the word breakdowns with data such as definitions, grammar information, related words, and examples
and then displays this information to users for them to study.

## How is the Rootski project run? (Hint, click here to [get involved](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Knowledge-Base-49bb8843b6424ada9f49c22151014cfc) üòÉ)

Rootski is developed by volunteers!

Above all else, Rootski is a platform to learning and mentoring anyone with an interest in

- frontend/backend development
- developing data science models
- data engineering
- analytics
- MLOps
- DevOps
- UI/UX design
- product design
- building a SaaS product that handles real customer transactions (note, we're aware of GDPR and data privacy regulations and do not expose the subset of customer data that is sensitive to contributors)
- running a business

The best way to learn to write production-ready software is to... write production-ready software ü§£. If one of these describes you, you may really enjoy contributing some pieces to Rootski,

- you are inexperienced at writing software, modeling, doing analytics, etc., but you would love to learn how it is done--ideally with the guidance of some really experienced, friendly mentors
- you work in some area of tech for you day job and want to explore areas to keep growing, but you don't necessarily want to build an entire SaaS product yourself just to learn about a handful of sub-parts of that

Engineers learn a lot by seeing examples of how things are built. The difficulty there is that
you typically have to join a company to see the inside of a large SaaS product. Rootski is "built in the open"
so that anyone interested in software or data science can see a fully working example of an SaaS/AI
product built with industry best practices.

If you're [willing to learn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eric-riddoch_im-willing-to-learn-candidates-for-ds-activity-6895803295609233408-dKmu), we'd love to have you on our team!

We have training materials that can take you from whatever experience level you may be at and get you onboarded and contributing.

To get started, head over to our [knowledge base](https://quickest-trail-808.notion.site/Rootski-Knowledge-Base-49bb8843b6424ada9f49c22151014cfc).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer, please read! This is 100% "free labor" in the sense that Eric Riddoch owns the Rootski project. The value of contributing to rootski is really in getting to work on part of a real product, having mentorship, and experimenting with tools you don't use at your day job. Whether or not you're experienced, that "mentorship" looks exactly the way it would at a paid job: we're a bunch of non-experts working together, some of us knowing more about certain technologies than others. For Eric, this project truly is about learning/mentoring and he'd rather move really slowly so that people can learn rather than focus on exploiting people adding new features. Eric pays $20+/mo (sometimes $50) on this and earns nothing. If that ever changes, he will be clear about that. If anyone were to be paid to work on this, the project simply wouldn't be possible. Eric is happy if the work we're doing here does nothing more than give people career opportunities and help remove confusion about how "real" software is built. Many of the contributors make real sacrifices offering their time and mentorship working on this project. Please don't criticize our motives. We truly do want you do do what's best for you. Please *do* or please *don't* contribute based on what you think is best for your career and personal growth. This model for building a product was inspired by this [podcast interview with the creator of the Python discord channel](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/305/python-community-at-python-discord). Eric finds their intentions to be genuine. Please know that for over a year, Eric has "sunk" many evenings and weekends mentoring engineers and has seen no personal "return on investment" outside of relationships; he will gladly continue to do so, time permitting. Feel free to reach out to any of the "Contributors" or "Friends" to ask them about their experience.

## The Technical Stuff

### How to deploy an entire Rootski environment from scratch

Going through this, you'll notice that there are several one-time, manual steps. This is common even for teams
with a heavily automated infrastructure-as-code workflow, particularly when it comes to the creation of users
and storing of credentials.

Once these steps are complete, all subsequent interactions with our Rootski infrastructure can be done
using our infrastructure as code and other automation tools.

#### 1. Create an AWS account and user

1. Create an IAM user with programmatic access
2. Install the AWS CLI
3. Run `aws configure --profile rootski` and copy the credentials from step (1). Set the region to `us-west-2`.

> üóí Note: this IAM user will need sufficient permissions to create and access the infrastructure that will
be discussed below. This includes creating several types of infrastructure using CloudFormation.

#### 2. Create an SSH key pair

1. In the AWS console, go to EC2 and create an SSH key pair named `rootski`.
2. Download the key pair.
3. Save the key pair somewhere you won't forget. If the pair isn't already named, I like to rename them and store them at `~/.ssh/rootski/rootski.id_rsa` (private key) and `~/.ssh/rootski/rootski.id_rsa.pub` (public key).
4. Create a new GitHub account for a "Machine User". Copy/paste the contents of `rootski.id_rsa.pub` into any boxes you have to to make this work :D
this "machine user" is now authorized to clone the rootski repository!

#### 3. Create several parameters in AWS SSM Parameter Store

| Parameter      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `/rootski/ssh/private_key`      | The contents of the private key needed to clone the `rootski` repository.       |
| `/rootski/prod/database_config`   | A stringified JSON object with database connection information (see below) |

```json
{
    "postgres_user": "rootski-db-user",
    "postgres_password": "rootski-db-pass",
    "postgres_host": "database.rootski.io",
    "postgres_port": "5432",
    "postgres_db": "rootski-db-database-name"
}
```

#### 4. Purchase a domain name that happens to be `rootski.io`

You know, the domain name `rootski.io` is hard coded in a few places throughout the Rootski infrastructure.
It felt wasteful to parameterize this everywhere since... it's unlikely that we will ever change our domain name.

If we ever have a need for this, we can revisit it :D

#### 5. Create an ACM TLS certificate verified with the DNS challenge for `*.rootski.io`

You'll need to do this in the AWS console. This certificate will allow us to access `rootski.io`
and all of its subdomains over HTTPS. You'll need the ARN of this certificate for a later step.

#### 4. Create the rootski infrastructure

Before running these commands, copy/paste the ARN of the `*.rootski.io` ACM certificate
into the appropriate place in `infrastructure/iac/cloudformation/front-end/static-website.yml`.

```bash
# create the S3 bucket and Route53 hosted zone for hosting the React application as a static site
...

# create the AWS Cognito user pool
...

# create the AWS Lightsail instance with the backend database (simultaneously deploys the database)
...

# deploy the API Gateway and Lambda function
...
```

#### 5. Deploy the frontend site

```bash
make deploy-frontend
```

DONE! -->
